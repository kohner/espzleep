# ESP Zzzzleep ðŸ˜´

## Bill of Materials / Things You'll Need
- ESP8266 (microcontroller)
- GY-521 MPU-6050 (accelerometer / gyroscope sensor)
- breadboard and wires
- power supply or powerbank for independant operation
- soldering iron for preparation of the sensor module

## Complete Setup Instructions
We assume you are starting from scratch; only in posession of items mentioned in the BoM.

#### 1. Preparation
If your sensor comes with seperate header pins it is recommended to solder them onto the chip first (the ESP usually ships with presoldered header pins). If you are just getting started with soldering you can find guidance on this task here: https://www.instructables.com/Solder-Arduino-Header-Pins-Easily/

#### 2. Assembly and Wiring
- Stick the sensor and the ESP onto the breadboard similar to how it is shown in the first image
- Attach the wires according to the scheme presented in the second image

#### 3. Preparing your ESP8266
Setup Arduino IDE with ESP8266 on your computer. You need to do this in order to compile and upload the code onto the ESP. Follow advice from these sites if you don't know how to do this:
- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide
- https://www.instructables.com/Setting-Up-the-Arduino-IDE-to-Program-ESP8266

When your Arduino IDE is ready to upload to ESP8266 copy and paste the code from esp.ino into Arduino IDE and edit ssid, password and ip address (insert the ip address of the machine running the Streams-HTTP-Gateway) before hitting upload. Make sure you choose the appropriate board and USB port.

#### 4. Start Streams-HTTP-gateway
Install the Streams-HTTP-gateway available on https://github.com/iot2tangle/Streams-http-gateway

Start the server and you should see requests coming in after a few seconds.

#### 5. View online
Firstly get your channel id by sending a specific GET request to your server:
```curl --location --request GET '127.0.0.1:8080/current_channel' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{ "device": "DEVICE_ID_1" }'```

You can run this command as it is from the server itself or adjust the server ip address (127.0.0.1) and run it from another machine.

Port 8080 is the default port used by the Streams-HTTP-gateway.

The channel id will be sent as a response so it will appear in the terminal where curl was run.


Secondly go to https://explorer.iot2tangle.io and enter the channel address.

#### 5. Analyze!
Analyze the data using Spreadsheets or another method. For example I'm currently working on a python script to visualize the collected data.

Information about your sleep cycles can provide valuable insights. You can find out for example different parameters which can influence your sleep quality or your long-term sleep habits.
